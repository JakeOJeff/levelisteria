# Levelisteria

A demo project about gamifying life, built to showcase a React-like UI library that Iâ€™m developing in parallel in this same repo for creating mobile applications.

## Overview

The goal of this demo is to explore how a lightweight, React-style architecture can be applied to building mobile UIs. It helps validate concepts such as component rendering, state handling, and layout strategies before they are integrated into the main library.

The code here is not meant to be production-ready, but rather a working demonstration of the underlying principles.

## Features

- React-like component system written in Lua & Love2d

- Demo screens to test UI structures and interactions

- Built as a companion to the main UI library project

- Lightweight, with minimal external dependencies
